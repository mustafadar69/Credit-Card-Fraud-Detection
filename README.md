# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card frauds are more common than you think, and lately, they’ve been on the higher side.
Figuratively speaking, we’re on the path to cross a billion credit card users by the end of 2022.
But thanks to the innovations in technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science, 
credit card companies have been able to successfully identify and intercept these frauds with sufficient accuracy.Simply put, the idea
behind this is to analyze the customer’s usual spending behavior, including mapping the location of those spendings to identify the
fraudulent transactions from the non-fraudulent ones. For this project, you can use either R or Python with the customer’s transaction
history as the dataset and ingest it into decision trees, Artificial Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression. As you feed more data to
your system, you should be able to increase its overall accuracy.
